# Nosetests

Because I can never remember...execute with `nosetests my_test.py` in this folder.

Right now, various options are in the setup.cfg (some problems with logging - see
notes in the .cfg file).

# Pytests

```
# Test all under the current directory
pytest-3
# Test a single script
pytest-3 test_copyright.py
```
