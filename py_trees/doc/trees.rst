Trees
=====

While a graph of connected behaviours and composites form a tree in their own right
(i.e. it can be initialised and ticked), it is usually convenient to wrap your tree
in another class to take care of alot of the housework and provide some extra bells
and whistles that make your tree flourish.

This library provides a default reference implementation that is directly usable, but
can also be easily used as inspiration for your own tree custodian.
